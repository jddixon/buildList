    * running blListGen without -s suggests that deserialization 
        does not work if there is no digital signature
    * blBootstrap should populate example/uDir

2015-05-05 (edited from 04-12)
    * recheck sanity checks in blCheck/ListGen/SrcGen                   * DONE
    * move their doIt code into buildList/__init__.py
    * for interoperability tests need 
        - a directory example/                                          * DONE
        - a valid buildList example/example.bld                         * DONE
        - a directory tree example/dataDir/                             * DONE
        - an appropriate example/uDir/
        - and a serialized RSA private key, ckPriv.pem                  * DONE
        - make sure buildList lines are CR-LF terminated                * DONE
    * everything under example/ is read-only if at all possible

    * what is now BuildList.__init__() morphs into createFromFileSystem * DONE
        with the __init__() method acquiring a tree parameter           * DONE
    * need the usual serialization/deserialization tests, where the     * DONE
        buildList is first created from scratch, then written to        * DONE
        disk, then deserialized, and then the two objects are           * DONE
        tested for equality                                             * DONE
    * createFromFileSystem: path must not contain . or .. parts

    * XXX testBuildList fails, line 54                                  * FIXED
    * Python time.time() delivers microseconds, which we truncate
        - to retain, serialization must capture
    * IMPORTANT: need working -X/--exclude
        - must collect exclusions as list
        - must collect matchPats as list

    * BuildList.__init__() needs sanity checks on parameters
2015-05-02
    * timestamp should be a 64-bit signed value representing seconds
        from the Epoch (nanoseconds?)

    * FIXME: old makeListing code doesnt' work because of casual        * GONE
        intermixing of strings and bytearrays                           * GONE
2015-04-27
    * data12 is missing (should be present but an empty file)           * FIXED
    * public key should be wrapped in a standard way in the             * DONE
        serialization                                                   * DONE
    * consider omitting CRLF and content delimiter lines when           * SKIP
        calculating the digital signature                               * SKIP

    * class BuildList should extend SignedList
    * BuildList should be sorted by path to file, which should
        always be relative 
        - sort guarantees file uniqueness
        - forbid '/' as a leading character
        - forbid internal './' and '../' sequences

2015-04-15
    * data12 should be empty but is being filled with random data       * FIXED
    * need node/ckPriv with serialized RSA private key                  * DONE
    * need a build list, example.bld                                    * DONE
    * need udir/ populated

2014-10-01
    * implement blListGen code to handle -u option and copy input 
        to uDir
