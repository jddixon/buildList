    * make it possible to move testRSA to xlattice_py                   * DONE
2015-05-12
    * get blSrcGen working using checkBlSrcGen
2015-05-12 (edited from -11)
    * if uDir != None (ie, -u is present), blListGen should create 
        uDir if it does not exist and then should invoke 
        BuildList.copyWalk(dataDir, uDir)
        - then BuildList.checkWalk() must succeed
        - it should be OK if uDir already exists (in fact this
            will be the usual case)
    * write checkExample which uses blCheck to verify that the 
        buildList in example/example.bld is correct 
        - and that every file under dataDir is in example/uDir
        - (but not necessarily vice versa)

2015-05-07
    * get blCheck running (use script checkExample)                     * DONE
    * TILT: sha1sum for an empty file returns 0xda39a3ee...             * OK 
        - this appears to be consistent; two empty files return         * OK
            the same hash to u.filesha1 and system sha1sum              * OK
        - same value is returned by sha1sum of empty file on portland   * OK
        - however empty directory in BuildList has SHA1_NONE as hash    * FIXED

2015-05-05
    * running blListGen without -s suggests that deserialization        * FIXED
        does not work if there is no digital signature                  * FIXED
    * blBootstrap should populate example/uDir                          * DONE

2015-05-05 (edited from 04-12)
    * recheck sanity checks in blCheck/ListGen/SrcGen                   * DONE
    * move their doIt code into buildList/__init__.py
    * for interoperability tests need 
        - a directory example/                                          * DONE
        - a valid buildList example/example.bld                         * DONE
        - a directory tree example/dataDir/                             * DONE
        - an appropriate example/uDir/                                  * DONE
        - and a serialized RSA private key, skPriv.pem                  * DONE
        - make sure buildList lines are CR-LF terminated                * DONE
    * everything under example/ is read-only if at all possible

2015-05-04
    * what is now BuildList.__init__() morphs into createFromFileSystem * DONE
        with the __init__() method acquiring a tree parameter           * DONE
    * need the usual serialization/deserialization tests, where the     * DONE
        buildList is first created from scratch, then written to        * DONE
        disk, then deserialized, and then the two objects are           * DONE
        tested for equality                                             * DONE
    * createFromFileSystem: path must not contain . or .. parts

    * XXX testBuildList fails, line 54                                  * FIXED
    * Python time.time() delivers microseconds, which we truncate
        - to retain, serialization must capture
    * IMPORTANT: need working -X/--exclude
        - must collect exclusions as list
        - must collect matchPats as list

2015-05-03
    * BuildList.__init__() needs sanity checks on parameters
2015-05-02
    * timestamp should be a 64-bit signed value representing seconds
        from the Epoch (nanoseconds?)

2015-04-27
    * class BuildList should extend SignedList
    * BuildList should be sorted by path to file, which should
        always be relative 
        - sort guarantees file uniqueness
        - forbid '/' as a leading character
        - forbid internal './' and '../' sequences

2015-04-15
    * need udir/ populated

2014-10-01
    * implement blListGen code to handle -u option and copy input 
        to uDir
