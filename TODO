    * recheck sanity checks in blCheck/ListGen/SrcGen                   * DONE
    * move their doIt code into buildList/__init__.py
    * for interoperability tests need 
        - a read-only directory example/
        - a valid buildList example/buildList.dat, 
        - a directory tree example/data/ 
        - an appropriate example/uDir/
        - and a node with its ID, ck/ckPriv, and sk/skPriv serialized 
            under example/.xlattice/
        - make sure buildList lines are CR-LF terminated
    * bin/bootStrap script creates all of this
    * everything under example/ is read-only if at all possible

    * implement blListGen code to handle -u option and copy input 
        to uDir
